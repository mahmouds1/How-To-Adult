                    We are two college students who will be graduating without knowing
                    some common skills that we will need when we go out into the world. We
                    chose to develop this website for those who were under similar circumstances
                    as us and to make discovering necessary tutorials easier for our users. 
                    Our goal is to simplify the process of googling videos and being redirected 
                    to YouTube and being overwhelmed with all the different videos to choose from.
                    Here we plan to have one to two videos associated with a tutorial topic that 
                    provide the best information to learn the topic.
