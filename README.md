# About The Project - [How To Adult]

Transitioning from adolescence to adulthood can be difficult for many individuals. 
A variety of people never learn how to carry out certain responsibilities from either school or their family, therefore, most might not acquire the vital life skills to aid in becoming independent and successful once they enter adulthood. To help simplify the process of learning these skills, How To Adult - a website to organize video tutorials for everyday tasks - came to be. It provides easier access to videos that can help the average young adult without overwhelming them like common websites such as YouTube or Google. How To Adult allows the user to navigate between various categories and subcategories to find a video that best fits their desired question. The How To Adult platform lays out a user-focused experience by allowing individuals to submit suggestions and questions in order to help improve the overall experience of the service.
